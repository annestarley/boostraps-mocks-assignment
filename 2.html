                <p><i>Tom's reply</i>: Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at dealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH
                  YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!!</p>

                <p><i>Bob</i>: It looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.</p>
                <p><i>Peter</i>: I wouldn't say I've been missing it Bob.</p>
                <hr>
                <p><i>Milton</i>: And I said, I don't care if they lay me off either, because I told, I told Bill that if they move my desk one more time, then, then I'm, I'm quitting, I'm going to quit. And, and I told Don too, because they've moved my
                  desk four times already this year, and I used to be over by the window, and I could see the squirrels, and they were merry, but then, they switched from the Swingline to the Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline stapler because it
                  didn't bind up as much, and I kept the staples for the Swingline stapler and it's not okay because if they take my stapler then I'll set the building on fire...

                  <p><i>Milton</i>: Yeah, but last time I didn't receive a piece. And I was told...</p>
                  <p><i>Nina</i>: Just pass.</p>
